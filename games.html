                    A top down 2d game the combines pixel and hand drawn art. Developed for the game jam, Sea Jam 2021, as part of MrBeast's ocean clean up activity, Dross follows the titular
                    humanized hermit crab who acquired a metal detector and uses it to try to find treasure while accidentally cleaning up the sea.
                    <br>
                    I wanted to create a simple gameplay loop with prioties toward the art and story. The pixel art was made in Aseprite and the character art was made in Medibang. The overall theme of the game
                    is to promote beach cleanup, and that even with ulterior motives, one can make their environment a better place.

                  This was my capstone project in college. Both my partner and I put a lot of effort into this. While it needs some polishing, I feel like this a good foundation to build off.
